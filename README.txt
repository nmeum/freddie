To install, run
	go get -u github.com/nmeum/go-feedparser

This is a simple yet powerful feed parser. It is easily extendible and
supports RSS and ATOM feeds. Furthermore it also supports different XML
encodings using "golang.org/x/text/encoding". The code was originally
imported from cpod <https://github.com/nmeum/cpod> and is licensed under
GNU GPLv3 (or later). Documentation is missing at the moment, the tests
are not completed yet and the API might still be subject to change.
