go-feedparser - Simple RSS and ATOM feed parser.

To install, run
	go get -u github.com/nmeum/go-feedparser

This is a simple feed parser. Currently it supports RSS2 and ATOM web
feeds. It uses "golang.org/x/text/encoding" and thus supports non-UTF8
encoded feeds. The code was originally imported from cpod
<https://github.com/nmeum/cpod> and is licensed under GNU GPLv3 (or
later).

Documentation is missing at the moment and the tests are not completed yet.
