go-feedparser - Simple and extendible feed parser.

This is a simple yet powerful feed parser. It is easily extendible and
supports RSS and ATOM feeds. Furthermore it also supports different XML
encodings using "golang.org/x/text/encoding". The entire thing is
licensed under GNU GPLv3 (or later). Documentation is missing at the
moment, the tests are not completed yet and the API might still be
subject to change.
